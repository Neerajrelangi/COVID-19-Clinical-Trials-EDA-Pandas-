🦠 COVID-19 Clinical Trials – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 clinical trial data sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, a publicly available repository maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The objective of the project is to analyze global clinical trial activities related to COVID-19 and extract meaningful insights regarding trial status, geographic distribution, enrollment patterns, gender eligibility, and timelines. By working with real-world healthcare data, the project demonstrates practical data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and visualization skills essential for data analyst and data science roles.
The dataset consists of approximately 5,700 clinical trial records with multiple categorical and numerical features, including trial status, conditions, interventions, phases, enrollment size, locations, and important dates. Due to the real-world nature of the dataset, it contains missing values, high-cardinality categorical variables, and skewed numerical data. Data preprocessing involved removing highly incomplete columns, handling missing values using statistically appropriate methods, eliminating duplicates, and creating new features such as extracting country information from location data.
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of clinical trials across countries, analyze the status of trials (recruiting, completed, active, etc.), examine gender eligibility trends, study enrollment size behavior, and observe temporal patterns in trial initiation. Multiple visualizations were generated, including bar charts for country contributions and trial status, gender distribution plots, missing data analysis, and time-based trend analysis. All visual outputs were saved programmatically to ensure reproducibility and ease of reporting.
The project outputs include a cleaned and processed dataset, saved visualization images, and a Python script version of the analysis, making it suitable for cloud deployment, academic submission, or portfolio presentation. This project provides a strong foundation for understanding healthcare datasets and can be extended further with machine learning models, time-series forecasting, or interactive dashboards using tools such as Power BI or Streamlit.
